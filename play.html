      <h2>The Duchess of Padua</h2>
      <h4>ACT II<br>
         SCENE<br>
         _Room in the Duke’s Palace_<br>

         _A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
         the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
         of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
         canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
         the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
         the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
         gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
         _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
         into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
         cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
         very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
         enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.

         No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
         Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.

      <h5 class=" name MAFFIO">MAFFIO</h5>
      <p class="stage-direction">[_excitedly_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
         Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
         Who every moment grow more clamorous.
      </p>

      <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
         People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
         The only men I fear are silent men.
      </p>
      <p class="stage-direction">[_A yell from the people_.]</p> 

      <h5 class="name CARDINAL">CARDINAL</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         I beseech your Grace
         To listen to their grievances.</p>

      <h5 class=" name DUKE">DUKE</h5>
      <p class="stage-direction">[_sitting on his throne_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
            Ay! the peaches
            Are not so big this year as they were last.
            I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
            I thought you spake of peaches.

      <p class="stage-direction">[_rushes to the window_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
         The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
         And stands between the people and the guard,
         And will not let them shoot.
      </p>

      <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         The devil take her!</p>

      <p class="stage-direction">[_still at the window_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
         And followed by a dozen of the citizens
         Has come into the Palace.
      </p>

      <h5 class=" name DUKE">DUKE</h5>
      <p class="stage-direction">[_starting up_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
         By Saint James,
         Our Duchess waxes bold!
      </p>

      <h5 class="name BARDI">BARDI</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         Here comes the Duchess.</p>

         <h5 class=" name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h5>
      <p class="stage-direction">[_flinging herself upon her knees_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
         I do beseech your Grace to give us audience.
      </p>

      <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         What are these grievances?</p>

      <h5 class="name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         Alas, my Lord,
         Such common things as neither you nor I,
         Nor any of these noble gentlemen,
         Have ever need at all to think about;
         They say the bread, the very bread they eat,
         Is made of sorry chaff.</p>

      <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         And very good food too,
      I give it to my horses.</p>


      <h5 class=" name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h5>
      <p class="stage-direction">[_restraining herself_]</p> 
      <p class="speech">
         They say the water,
         Set in the public cisterns for their use,
         <p  class="stage-direction"> [Has, through the breaking of the aqueduct,]</p>
      
         To stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned.
      </p>

      <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         They should drink wine; water is quite unwholesome.</p>

         <h5 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs
         Take at the city gate are grown so high
         We cannot buy wine.</p>


         <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
         <p class="speech">
         
      Then you should bless the taxes

      Which make you temperate.</p>

      <h5 class="name DUCHESS">DUCHESS</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         Think, while we sit
      In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty
      Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives
      Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily
      And no word said.</p>

      <h5 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h5> 
      <p class="speech">
         If you are poor,
         Are you not blessed in that?  Why, poverty
         Is one of the Christian virtues,
      
      <p  class="stage-direction"> [_Turns to the_ CARDINAL.]</p>
      
         Is it not?
         I know, Lord Cardinal, you have great revenues,
         Rich abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates
         For preaching voluntary poverty.
      </p>
