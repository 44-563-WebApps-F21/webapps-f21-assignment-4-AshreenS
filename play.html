<h2>The Duchess of Padua</h2>
<h4>ACT II<br>
    SCENE<br>
     _Room in the Duke’s Palace_<br>

    _The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
    Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
    black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
    Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
    _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
    windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
    is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
    conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
    is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
    passing into the Cathedral_.</h4>



<p>
<b>GUIDO</b> Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!  [_Just as he is leaving the stage
with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a
silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the
Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches
him_.]<br><br>
   

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO</b>
   What!  Does my father live?<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   Ay! lives in thee.
   Thou art the same in mould and lineament,
   Carriage and form, and outward semblances;
   I trust thou art in noble mind the same.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO</b>
   Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived
   But for this moment.<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   We must be alone.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO</b>
   This is my dearest friend, who out of love
   Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,
   There is no secret which we do not share.<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   There is one secret which ye shall not share;
   Bid him go hence.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO [_to_ ASCANIO]</b>
   Come back within the hour.
   He does not know that nothing in this world
   Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.
   Within the hour come.<br><br>

<b>ASCANIO</b>
   Speak not to him,
   There is a dreadful terror in his look.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO [_laughing_]</b>
   Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
   That I am some great Lord of Italy,
   And we will have long days of joy together.
   Within the hour, dear Ascanio.<br><br>
                                                         [_Exit_ ASCANIO.]<br><br>


   Now tell me of my father?  [_Sits down on a stone seat_.]
   Stood he tall?
   I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.
   His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,
   Like a red fire of gold?  Was his voice low?
   The very bravest men have voices sometimes
   Full of low music; or a clarion was it
   That brake with terror all his enemies?
   Did he ride singly? or with many squires
   And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?
   For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins
   Beat with the blood of kings.  Was he a king?<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO [_proudly_]</b>
   Then when you saw my noble father last
   He was set high above the heads of men?<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   Ay, he was high above the heads of men,<br><br>

[_Walks over to_ GUIDO _and puts his hand upon his shoulder_.]

   On a red scaffold, with a butcher’s block
   Set for his neck.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO [_leaping up_]</b>
   What dreadful man art thou,
   That like a raven, or the midnight owl,
   Com’st with this awful message from the grave?<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   I am known here as the Count Moranzone,
   Lord of a barren castle on a rock,
   With a few acres of unkindly land
   And six not thrifty servants.  But I was one
   Of Parma’s noblest princes; more than that,
   I was your father’s friend.<br><br>

<b>GUIDO [_clasping his hand_]</b>
   Tell me of him.<br><br>

<b>MORANZONE</b>
   You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,
   He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke
   Of all the fair domains of Lombardy
   Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even
   Was wont to pay him tribute—<br><br>

<b>GUIDO</b><br>
   Come to his death.<br>
