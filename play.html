<h2>The Duchess of Padua</h2>
<h4>ACT II<br>
    SCENE<br>
     _Room in the Duke’s Palace_<br>

     _A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
     the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
     of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
     canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
     the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
     the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
     gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
     _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
     into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
     cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
     very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
     enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.</h4>

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5> 
<p class="speech">
   Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!</p>
   <p class="stage-direction">
      [_Just as he is leaving the stage
   with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a
   silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the
   Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches
   him_.]</p>
   

<h5 class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
  <p class="speech">Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.</p> 

<h5  class=" name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>
  <p class="speech">What!  Does my father live?</p> 

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
 <p class="speech"> Ay! lives in thee.
   Thou art the same in mould and lineament,
   Carriage and form, and outward semblances;
   I trust thou art in noble mind the same.</p> 

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>
  <p class="speech">Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived
   But for this moment.</p> 

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
  <p class="speech"> We must be alone.</p>

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>
  <p class="speech">This is my dearest friend, who out of love
   Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,
   There is no secret which we do not share.</p> 

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
 <p class="speech">There is one secret which ye shall not share;
   Bid him go hence.</p>  

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO </h5>
<p class="stage-direction">[_to_ ASCANIO]</p>
  <p class="speech">Come back within the hour.
   He does not know that nothing in this world
   Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.
   Within the hour come.</p> 

<h5 class="name ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h5>
  <p class="speech">Speak not to him,
   There is a dreadful terror in his look.</p> 

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO </h5>
<p class="stage-direction">[_laughing_]</p>
   <p class="speech">Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
      That I am some great Lord of Italy,
      And we will have long days of joy together.
      Within the hour, dear Ascanio.</p>
                                                        <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ ASCANIO.]</p> 


  <p class="speech">Now tell me of my father? <p>[_Sits down on a stone seat_.]</p> 
   Stood he tall?
   I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.
   His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,
   Like a red fire of gold?  Was his voice low?
   The very bravest men have voices sometimes
   Full of low music; or a clarion was it
   That brake with terror all his enemies?
   Did he ride singly? or with many squires
   And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?
   For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins
   Beat with the blood of kings.  Was he a king?</p> 

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
   <p class="speech">Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.</p>

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5><p class="stage-direction">[_proudly_]</p> 
  <p class="speech"> Then when you saw my noble father last
   He was set high above the heads of men?</p>

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
   <p class="speech">Ay, he was high above the heads of men,

     <p class="stage-direction">[_Walks over to_ GUIDO _and puts his hand upon his shoulder_.]</p> 
      
         On a red scaffold, with a butcher’s block
         Set for his neck.</p>

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>
<p class="stage-direction">[_leaping up_]</p> 
   <p class="speech">What dreadful man art thou,
      That like a raven, or the midnight owl,
      Com’st with this awful message from the grave?</p>

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
   <p class="speech">I am known here as the Count Moranzone,
      Lord of a barren castle on a rock,
      With a few acres of unkindly land
      And six not thrifty servants.  But I was one
      Of Parma’s noblest princes; more than that,
      I was your father’s friend.</p>

<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>
<p class="stage-direction">[_clasping his hand_]</p> 
   <p class="speech">Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
      Tell me of him.</p> 

<h5  class=" name MORANZONE">MORANZONE</h5>
   <p class="speech">Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
      You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,
   He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke
   Of all the fair domains of Lombardy
   Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even
   Was wont to pay him tribute—
</p> 
<h5 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h5>
   <p class="speech">Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell
      Come to his death.</p>
